Simple File List is a basic file list with optional front-side uploader. Easily exchanges files with clients, customers, or within a group setting.

== Description ==

Simple File List is a basic file list with optional front-side uploader. The plugin provides an easy-to-integrate basic user interface allowing visitors, clients, customers, or associates to see a listing of your files (separate from the media library) and optionally upload files if you choose.

The list and/or the uploader can be turned on and off for the front-side of the website. You can show just the list, just the uploader, or both. You can also restrict uploading and/or viewing of the file list to only Admins or logged-in users. For list management, there is a page in the administration area which always shows both. Here you can easily view, upload, rename and delete files as needed.

Simple File List is also an alternative to using FTP or Dropbox for larger files. There's no need to deal with Dropbox or FTP usernames and passwords anymore! Everything is on your Wordpress website. All you need is a VPS or dedicated web server.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: Who is Simple File List for? =

= Q: Are the file uploaded to the Media Library? =

A: No, files are uploaded to a special folder inside your general WordPress uploads folder, or anywhere you specify.

= Q: Can people who upload overwrite existing files? =

A: No, files cannot be overwritten. If a file is uploaded having the same name as one already present, a series number is appended to the name ( filename_(2).ext ) You can use the renaming functionality to change this.

= Q: Can I place different lists in different places? =

A: Yes, with the optional Folder Support extension you can put different file lists on different posts, pages and widgets.

= Q: Are the files in the list searchable by Google and other search engines? =

A: Only if you place a list on the front-side of your website which is viewable to the general public. If you choose USER, ADMIN or NO, in the List Settings these files will not be indexed by search engines.

= Q: Can I customize the appearance of the list and uploader? =

A: Yes, the CSS is easily over-ridden, making it easy for anyone with CSS knowledge to customize the page design. Check the Instructions page within the plugin's admin panel for more info.

= Q: Can I create custom behavior after an upload completes? =

A: Yes, you can hook into the action "eeSFL_UploadCompleted" and do pretty much anything you want upon upload completion.

= Q: What is the maximum upload file size? =

A: This is a setting that you choose in the file configuration. The initial default is 8 MB. The absolute maximum size will depend on your hosting setup. which is automatically detected.

= Q: What if I have trouble or need assistance? Will you help? =

A: Yes! I enjoy helping people. Please contact me with any issues using the built in support form.

= Q: Why did you develop this plugin? =

A: I got tired of the difficulties of getting files back and forth between myself and my non-technical clients once they become too large for email. Training these people to use FTP or Dropbox was a challenge. I wanted something simple that I could use on my own website, so I created a simple index.php page that solved my problem. I later realized that others could benefit from this functionality, so I decided to port it to my favorite website platform; Wordpress. I also hoped that the donations would pay for a large home and a private jet, but that has not happened yet :-(  Regardless, I still enjoy giving to the community and helping others.
