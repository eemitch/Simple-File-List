Simple File List gives your WordPress website a list of your files which allows your users to open and download them.

== Description ==

Simple File List is a plugin that gives your WordPress website a list of your files allowing your users to open and download them. Users can also upload files if you choose.

Simple File List is also an alternative to using FTP or Dropbox for larger files. There's no need to deal with Dropbox or FTP usernames and passwords anymore! Everything is on your Wordpress website.

* Complete settings for: list display and performance, file uploading restrictions, upload notifications and additional functionality options. 
* Both the Front-side List and Uploader can be shown to users based on their role; Everyone, Only Logged-in User, Only Admins or Nobody.
* Optionally collect the uploader's name, email and description of the file(s). This can then be shown in the file list.
* Files can also be assigned descriptions, which can be added from the Admin list or user uploads. Descriptions can be shown or hidden.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: Who is Simple File List for? =

A: This script is for media companies, print houses, educational institutions, music sites, etcâ€¦ Anyone who exchanges files with clients and customers, or within a group setting.

= Q: Are the file uploaded to the Media Library? =

A: No, files are uploaded to a special folder inside your general WordPress uploads folder, or anywhere you specify.

= Q: Can people who upload overwrite existing files? =

A: No, files cannot be overwritten. If a file is uploaded having the same name as one already present, a series number is appended to the name ( filename_(2).ext ) You can use the renaming functionality to change this.

= Q: Can I place different lists in different places? =

A: Yes, with the optional Folder Support extension you can put different file lists on different posts, pages and widgets.

= Q: Are the files in the list searchable by Google and other search engines? =

A: Only if you place a list on the front-side of your website which is viewable to the general public. If you choose USER, ADMIN or NO, in the List Settings these files will not be indexed by search engines.

= Q: Can I customize the appearance of the list and uploader? =

A: Yes, the CSS is easily over-ridden, making it easy for anyone with CSS knowledge to customize the page design. Check the Instructions page within the plugin's admin panel for more info.

= Q: Can I create custom behavior after an upload completes? =

A: Yes, you can hook into the actions "eeSFL_UploadCompleted" and "eeSFL_UploadCompletedAdmin" and do pretty much anything you want upon upload completion.

= Q: What is the maximum upload file size? =

A: This is a setting that you choose in the file configuration. The initial default is 8 MB. The absolute maximum size will depend on your hosting setup. which is automatically detected.

= Q: What if I have trouble or need assistance? Will you help? =

A: Yes! I enjoy helping people. Please contact me with any issues using the built in support form.

= Q: Why did you develop this plugin? =

A: I got tired of the difficulties of getting files back and forth between myself and my non-technical clients once they become too large for email. Training these people to use FTP or Dropbox was a challenge. I wanted something simple that I could use on my own website, so I created a simple index.php page that solved my problem. I later realized that others could benefit from this functionality, so I decided to port it to my favorite website platform; Wordpress. I also hoped that the donations would pay for a large home and a private jet, but that has not happened yet :-(  Regardless, I still enjoy giving to the community and helping others.
